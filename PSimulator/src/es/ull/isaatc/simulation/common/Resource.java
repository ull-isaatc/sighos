 * A simulation resource whose availability is controlled by means of timetable entries.
 * A timetable entry us a trio &lt{@link ResourceType}, {@link SimulationCycle}, long&gt which defines a 
 * resource type, an availability cycle, and the duration of each availability period. Timetable entries 
 * can be overlapped in time, thus allowing the resource for being potentially available for
 * different resource types simultaneously.
 * A resource finishes its execution when it has no longer valid timetable entries.
