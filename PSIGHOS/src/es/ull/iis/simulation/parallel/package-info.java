/**
 * Provides the core classes necessary to create any model and to simulate it.
 * This package implements a kind of parallel Three-Phase simulation approach. When used 
 * purely, the three-phase approach divides the events in Bs and Cs. Bs are events 
 * scheduled to be executed at a specific timestamp, whereas Cs are conditional events.
