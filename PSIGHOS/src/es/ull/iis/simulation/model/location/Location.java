 * A physical place where one or more entities can be at any time. Locations have a capacity, that determines how many entities fit in.
 * Entities leaving a location can suffer a delay. Such delay can also represents the time that the entity takes to go through the location.
 * Entities can move from one location to another linked location. Such connections are defined by using {@link #linkTo(Location)}, and have a direction,
 * i.e. an entity can move from a location to another, but not back, unless a explicit link is created in the opposite way.
