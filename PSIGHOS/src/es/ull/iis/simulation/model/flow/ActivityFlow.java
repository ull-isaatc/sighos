/**
 * A flow which executes a single activity. An activity is characterized by a priority and a set of {@link WorkGroup workgropus}. 
 * Each workgroup represents a combination of resource types required for carrying out the activity, and also defines different workgroup-specific
 * durations of the activity.<p>
 * 
 * By default, activities are exclusive, that is, an element carrying out this activity can't perform simultaneously any other exclusive
 * activity; and ininterruptible, i.e., once started, the activity keeps its resources until it's finished, even if the resources become 
 * unavailable while the activity is being performed. These characteristics can be modified by means of different constructors.<p>
 * 
 * When an element requests an activity, it checks whether there is a least one workgroup with enough available resources to perform the activity. 
 * The condition for the workgroup has to be met too.<p>
 * 
 * After performing the activity, some resources can be "cancelled", i.e., can become unavailable during certain amount of time. The cancellation can 
 * be condition-driven.
