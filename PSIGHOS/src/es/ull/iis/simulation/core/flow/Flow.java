 * The process an element has to carry out.<p>
 * A flow is structured as a graph, so it can have successors and predecessor. Successors can be
 * added by using {@link #link(Flow)}. This implies invoking the {@link #addPredecessor(Flow)} 
 * method for the new successor. By creating this basic structure, the Sequence workflow pattern
 * (WFP1) is implemented.<p>
 * Flows can have not only successors and predecessors, but can be enclosed by an structured 
 * flow, which is considered its parent.<p>
 * This flow can be requested to be carried out by an element. To do this, a set of user-defined 
 * conditions are first checked by invoking <code>beforeRequest</code>. If this method is true, 
 * the Element can definitely request this flow.
